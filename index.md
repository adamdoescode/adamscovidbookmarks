# A curated list of Covid-19 bookmarks

## Introduction

My firefox bookmarks related to the Covid-19 crisis has grown large and unruly. So I thought it might be easier to have them curated and listed here where I can format them a bit easier.

## Global resources

[JHH GISAID dashboard](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6)
The signature (and obligatory) John Hopkin's dashboard. Mostly useful for America and a quick overview of official state of the pandemic.

[NextStrain dashboard on the genomic epidemiology for Covid-19](https://nextstrain.org/ncov)
Plenty of very insightful information here. Try clicking on the mutations in mutation frequency graph down the bottom to see the geographic distribution of mutations. Probably one of my favourite websites on this topic.

[biomed-sanity](http://biomed-sanity.com/)
A website for quickly finding recent pre-prints of Covid-19 associated studies. A little easier to use than pubmed.

[Coronavirus charts for countries](https://mackuba.eu/corona/)
I find this is a great way to get quick cumulative case graphs for basically every country. Has some data cleaning issues but definitely useful for the casual observer.

## USA

[Covidtracking project](https://covidtracking.com/)
Best collated source for USA cases that I could find. The USA have taken a very federalist approach and it is difficult to find information from each state seperately.

## Germany

[Robert-Koch Institut dashboard](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/478220a4c454480e823b17327b2bf1d4/page/page_1/)
A good map and overview for Germany. I like this partly because Germany has more complete data than most countries that have experienced similar levels of cases.

## UK

[UK COG consortium](https://www.cogconsortium.uk/)
A large (and growing) collection of genomic data about Covid19 in the UK.

[UK government dashboard](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/)
Has all the right graphs and an epi curve. Curious to see the age distribution of cases in the UK. I suspect there are many undiagnosed cases in younger age brackets.

[Guernsey dashboard](https://covid19.gov.gg/test-results)
Cute, blurry excel graphs. I like the inclusion of a graph showing "mean contacts per case" which shows the impact of social distancing measures to reduce the spread. Some other graphs have questionable design choices, but I like this one overall.

## Italy

[Neat visualisation of cumulative cases over time in Italy](https://observablehq.com/@jashkenas/italy-coronavirus-daily-cases-map-covid-19)

## Japan

[Dashboard of Japanese cases](https://covid19japan.com/)
I quite like this one. Gives a good breakdown of cases in different regions. Clean graphs.

## Singapore

[Singapore dashboard](https://co.vid19.sg/singapore/)
Neat visualisation for Singaporean cases. Has a cool network graph which seems to be broken with the now massive caseload in Singapore.

## Australian specific resources

[Australian government information page](https://www.health.gov.au/news/health-alerts/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-health-alert/coronavirus-covid-19-current-situation-and-case-numbers)
Has a nice Epi curve and other graphs for Australian cases.

[Third party website with nice graphs](https://www.covid19data.com.au/)
Mostly the same as official sites, but has nice formating and some different ways of showing the numbers which can be insightful.

[Guardian Australia graphs](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/datablog/ng-interactive/2020/may/11/coronavirus-cases-australia-numbers-map-how-many-new-today-stats-statistics-charts-graphs-hotspots-by-postcode-covid-19-deaths-death-toll)
Well presented graphs from Guardian newspaper. Has some decent maps but I think better ones can be found elsewhere.

[ABC news graphs](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-03-17/coronavirus-cases-data-reveals-how-covid-19-spreads-in-australia/12060704?nw=0)
Basically the same as the Guardian graphs. But I prefer this one slightly. I usually just scroll straight to the epi curves stratified by state and click "last 14 days" to get a good picture of the developing situation.

[List of approve test kits in Australia](https://www.tga.gov.au/covid-19-test-kits-included-artg-legal-supply-australia)
The TGA has a published list of approved test kits in Australia. It is a long list, and I suspect many of the antibody kits don't see much real-world use here.

### NSW

[NSW government Covid-19 dashboard](https://www.nsw.gov.au/covid-19/find-facts-about-covid-19)
Nice graphs. Cool map with a slider. I wish the map had a toggle to show only active cases.

[NSW official covid-19 datasets](https://data.nsw.gov.au/nsw-covid-19-data)
NSW have released several datasets on the Covid-19 cases in the state. Cool!

[NSW Covid-19 case statistics](https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/covid-19/Pages/stats-nsw.aspx)
Not as impressive as the dashboard, but has some informative tables and blury but nice epi curve graph.

[Another case map for NSW](https://www.covid19sydney.com/)

### Victoria

[Victorian government PowerBI report](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiODBmMmE3NWQtZWNlNC00OWRkLTk1NjYtMjM2YTY1MjI2NzdjIiwidCI6ImMwZTA2MDFmLTBmYWMtNDQ5Yy05Yzg4LWExMDRjNGViOWYyOCJ9)
I personally am not terribly impressed by this one. But it does the job. Watch out for the two-colour gradient for the maps (hint: white is intermediate counts, not low).
